# Development Pipeline

## Pokemon Type Calculator (Coming Soon)
- Fairly simple implementation
    - Most of the logic is already implemented, just need to refactor it for html

##  LockForge (Coming Later)
- Implementation is gonna be very complicated with html and having a frontend with API calls.
    - Yeah, I'll deal with this later lol


## Elden Ring Builds (Coming Much Later)
- Just have some vague ideas of what I want to do here
